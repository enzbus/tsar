# `tsar`: time series auto-regressor

`tsar` is a Python library to model and forecast time series data. It operates on `pandas` dataframes and uses `numba` just-in-time compilation
to speed up some operations.

The algorithm used is described in the draft paper [*Seasonally-Adjusted Auto-Regression of Vector Time Series*, E. Busseti, November 2019.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01010)"


### Installation

**Note: `tsar` is currently under development and is not suitable for
use in production.**

To install, execute in a terminal

```
pip install tsar
```
