# `tsar`: time series auto-regressor

`tsar` is a Python library to model and forecast time series data. It operates on `pandas` dataframes and uses `numba` just-in-time compilation
to speed up some operations.


`tsar` is based on the predictive model developed
in the recent paper
"[Dynamic energy management](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/dyn_ener_man.html)".

### Installation

**Note: `tsar` is currently under development and is not suitable for
use in production.**

To install, execute in a terminal

```
pip install tsar
```
